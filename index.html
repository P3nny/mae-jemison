                "More women should demand to be involved. It’s our right. This is one area where we can get in on the ground floor and possibly help to direct where space exploration will go in the future." – Dr. Mae Jemison

                "It's important not only for a little black girl growing up to know, yeah, you can become an astronaut because here's Mae Jemison, but it's important for older white males who sometimes make decisions on those careers of those little black girls." – Dr. Mae Jemison

                "When Mae Jemison was selected that was a huge deal. Of course we followed that. I remember the picture of her on the cover of Jet magazine, and that was legendary, and that was one of the landmark things in my mind. Gosh. I was still in high school, looking at that. I was just wowified, just absolutely wow." – Jeanette Jo Epps, Astronaut
